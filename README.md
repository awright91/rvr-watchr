# rvr-watchr

Rvr-watchr is a Django app that was built for whitewater kayakers. 

This app allows users to follow specific rivers and receive email updates when the river reaches specific water levels.

Using Beautiful Soup, this app scrapes water level data and inserts the data into the DB, where user's will receive updates
if the water level is higher than the "trigger level" that the user sets.
